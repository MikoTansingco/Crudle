# Crudle
CCAPDEV Machine Project by Eric Co and Miko Tansingco.
This website showcases allows people to display their artworks publicly, whatever they may be, as a show of their experience in artistry
and creativity, much like the artwork version of LinkedIn. Come with features such as ability to rate an artform, comment and give feedback, and edit 
your own profile and artwork (i.e. portfolios).

To run the project locally:
1. Download all included files onto a zipped folder in your computer, and then extract it to a new folder.
2. In your command prompt, navigate towards the new folder. You may do this more easily by copying tthe address
of the folder and typing cd [folder_name] (ex. cd C:\Users\Miko Tansingco\Documents\Crudle Folder)
3. Inside the folder in the command prompt, type the following commands:
    - npm init
    - npm install dotenv
    - npm install express --save
    - npm install body-parser
    - npm install mongodb --save
    - npm install fs
    - npm install cookie-parser
    - npm install bcrypt
    - npm install jsonwebtoken
    - npm install morgan
    - npm install mongoose
    - npm install hbs
4. Afterwards, type node index.js (or superviser index.js, if you have it installed), and wait for the message 
"Listening to port number 3000". 
5. Open up your brwoser, and go to this url link: http://localhost:3000/home
